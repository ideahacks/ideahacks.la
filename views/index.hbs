                <h3>About</h3>
                <p>For the fifth time in history, IEEE at UCLA and Theta Tau at UCLA are pleased to present to you California's largest college hardware-focused hackathon ever.</p>
                <p>At IDEA Hacks we provide our hackers with tools, such as 3D printers, soldering stations, and other equipment free of charge. Not only will these hackers code, but also they will create tangible products from scratch in one weekend.</p>
                <p>The theme for this year's hackathon is Travel Upgrade! This means that you will be challenged to create something that relates to upgrading the challenges found in commuting, travelling, and more.</p>

                    <h3>Who can attend?</h3>
                    <p>As we are still a young event, IDEA Hacks is primarily looking for UCLA students. However, all hackers are encouraged to apply as exceptions made on an application basis.</p>
                    <h3>I don't know anything about hardware!</h3>
                    <p>You are definitely not alone! During the hackathon, there will be workshops on hardware and hacking that will be accessible for everyone. There will also be mentors and other hardware experts ready to assist those who are having trouble bringing their hacks to life.</p>

                    <h2 class='ucla-gold background-transparent-ucla-gold'>Accommodations</h2>
                    <h3>How much does it cost?</h3>
                    <p>IDEA Hacks costs absolutely nothing to participate in. There is no reason not to come out, learn something new, and have fun!</p>
                    <h3>What should I bring?</h3>
                    <p>A valid ID is required for admission into Ackerman Grand Ballroom, so don't forget to bring it! If you don't live around UCLA, we recommend bringing necessary toiletries and a sleeping bag. We will have a sleeping/break room for hackers that want to relax and get some fresh air.</p>
                    <h3>Will food be provided?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Meals for all of the days of the hackathon will be provided for all hackers and participants. Please notify us of allergies or food preferences within your application and we'll do our best to accomodate.</p>
                    <h3>Will there be a free shirt?</h3>
                    <p>Yes! Very free, very shirt. Specify your size on our application.</p>
                    <h3>How about travel costs?</h3>
                    <p>Unfortunately, we will not be able to cover transportation costs for this year's event. If you plan on bringing a vehicle, we will include a map of UCLA's parking lots.</p>

                    <h2 class='ucla-gold background-transparent-ucla-gold'>Applications</h2>
                    <h3>How do I apply?</h3>
                    <p>Hackers can apply on this website! Applications usually open in the middle of Fall quarter and stay open up until a couple weeks before the hackathon. Make sure to keep an eye out for IDEA Hacks notifications on when to start applying. Applications are reviewed and accepted on a first come first serve basis, so apply early!</p>
                    <h3>What if I don't have a team?</h3>
                    <p>You are free to hack alone, but that's no fun! We encourage everyone to be on teams of around 4-5 hackers. Not only will you have more fun, but more equipment will be available for your use. That being said, we do hold a team formation session before hacking begins so that hackers can be successful in finding the right teammates.</p>
