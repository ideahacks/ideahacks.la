            <h2>WHO CAN ATTEND?</h2>
            <p>All students interested are encouraged to apply. Although we primarily cater to UCLA engineering students, everyone’s application will be considered.</p>
            <h2>WHAT IF I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HARDWARE?</h2>
            <p>You are definitely not alone! During the hackathon, there will be workshops on hardware and hacking that will be accessible for everyone. There will also be mentors and other hardware experts ready to assist those who are having trouble bringing their hacks to life.</p>
            <h2>WHAT DO HACKERS GAIN FROM PARTICIPATING?</h2>
            <p>In addition to being completely free, we will provide hackers free meals, a free shirt, a room to sleep in, and a chance to win a prize! The top three teams’ members will each receive a prize. Even more valuable, at our hackathon you will gain project experience and learn something new!</p>
            <h2>WHAT SHOULD I BRING?</h2>
            <p>A valid ID such as a student ID is required for admission into Ackerman Grand Ballroom. If you don't live around UCLA, we recommend bringing necessary toiletries and a sleeping bag.</p>
            <h2>WHAT ABOUT TRAVEL COSTS?</h2>
            <p>Unfortunately, we will not be able to cover transportation costs for this year's event. If you’re looking for details about the venue, look here. [insert link to “venue” page]</p>
            <h2>HOW DO I CONTACT IDEA HACKS?</h2>
            <p>Email us at team@ideahacks.la You can also like our Facebook page and follow us on Instagram.</p>

            <h2>HOW DO I APPLY?</h2>
            <p>Hackers can apply on this website! Applications will be out by early November, and will close in mid-December. To get an email reminder once the application gets sent out, like our Facebook page here. [link to Facebook page] Applications are reviewed and accepted on a first come first served basis, so apply early!</p>
            <h2>WHAT IF I DON'T HAVE A TEAM?</h2>
            <p>You are free to hack alone, but that's no fun! We encourage everyone to be on teams of around 4-5 hackers. If you do not sign up with a team, we hold a team formation session before hacking begins.</p>
            <h2>WHAT TOOLS AND HARDWARE WILL BE PROVIDED FOR MY TEAM?</h2>
            <p>If you would like to see a specific part or device at the hackathon, you can specify it on your application and we'll do our best to accommodate! When applications are released, we will also release a list of parts. In addition, keep in mind that you are not allowed to bring any hardware of your own to the hackathon.</p>
            <h2>HOW CAN I CHECK OUT PARTS DURING THE HACKATHON?</h2>
            <p>During the hackathon, you can simply approach our parts station and request a part from one of our volunteers. If it’s in stock, our volunteers will check the part out to your team.</p>
